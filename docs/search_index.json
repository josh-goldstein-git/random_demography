Ken’s model of Poisson heterogeneity Resources: Content is based on Section 8.8 from Wachter (2014) as well as Vaupel and Yashin (1985) for an accessible introduction to heterogeneity and overview. Derivations also from Keyfitz (2005). 2.2 Part I. Conceptual Introduction 2.2.1 What is Demographic Heterogeneity? If we see different outcomes (e.g., people dying at different ages), is this Demographic Heterogeneity? NO. Demographic heterogeneity \\(=\\) different rates for different folks. In a demographically heterogeneous population, people are of different types, with different type-specific rates. These types can be discrete, with individuals being homogeneous within their type, or they can be continuous with possibly no individual having exactly the same risk as another. NOTE: maybe add here a summary of Vaupel and Yashin (1985)? 2.2.2 An example Let’s draw 10 individuals from a homogeneous population and heterogeneous population. ## Homogeneous hazard of 1/10 set.seed(13) x.homo &lt;- rexp(10, rate = 1/10) ## Heterogeneous hazard (half 1/6 and half 1/13) ## Note: I didn&#39;t pick these particular numbers for any specific reason x.hetero &lt;- c(rexp(5, rate = 1/6), rexp(5, rate = 1/13)) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) dotchart(x.homo, main = &quot;homogenous variation&quot;) dotchart(x.hetero, main = &quot;heterogeneous variation&quot;) Figure 2.1: Homogeneity and Heterogeneity Can you tell which is which? Homogeneous: Chance only Heterogeneous: Chance + group variation in risk Would we expect to see a difference if we increased sample? ANSWER THIS Analogies ? Social inequality: equal opportunity vs. equal outcomes Analysis of variance \\(\\mbox{total variance} = \\mbox{within group} + \\mbox{between group}\\) Statistical models \\(y = a + b x + \\epsilon\\) What’s new? Dynamics. Heterogeneous populations evolve differently. Aggregates \\(\\neq\\) Individuals Rates of growth (or decline) Changes over time or age or duration The trajectory of even the individual differs from population average Relative positions, change of groups, may be misleading. Terminology Heterogeneity Unobserved heterogeneity Selection Selective survival Other terms? Big Caveat: Fundamental Unidentifiability Same data of \\(N\\) observations \\(N\\) draws from 1 distribution \\(1\\) draw from \\(N\\) distributions Something in-between Abel (66) and Beth (76) example. 2.2.3 A 2nd example: Exponential growth, two countries Two countries start equal size, but grow at different rates. What happens to aggregate growth rate? rA = .03 ## growth rate of A rB = .01 ## growth rate of A KA = 100 ## starting pop size KB = 100 t = 0:200 KA.t = KA*exp(rA*t) ## exp growth of A KB.t = KB*exp(rB*t) ## exp growth of B K &lt;- KA.t + KB.t ## combined pop r.bar = diff(log(K)) ## growth rate plot(t[-1], r.bar, type = &quot;l&quot;, ylim = c(0, 0.04), ylab = &quot;r.bar&quot;, xlab = &quot;time&quot;) abline(h = c(rA, rB), lty = 2) Figure 2.2: Aggregate growth rate of sub-populations A + B Questions What determines growth rate? How does it change over time? Does the process converge? 2.2.4 More examples to work Differential, constant mortality (\\(\\mu_A = .03\\); \\(\\mu_B =.01\\)) Differential, time-varying mortality or growth. ``Movers and Stayers’’ (Migration) ``Movers and Stayers’’ (Marriage) Fecundity: aging or heterogeneity? Divorce: duration or heterogeneity? Duration of unemployment: duration or heterogeneity? Recidivism by time out of prison 2.2.5 Application Questions Can you create a plateau? Can you create a crossover? Can you get aggregate rate to decline? Anything else? 2.3 Part II. Formal Analysis 2.3.1 Outline Keyfitz result Keyfitz USA-Mexico example Ken’s Poisson-Exponential Model 2.3.2 Keyfitz result \\[{d \\over dt}\\bar{r}(t) = \\sigma^2_r(t)\\] When group-specific growth rates are constant the rate of change of the aggregate growth rate equals the variance of the growth rates. Derivation By definition, \\[ \\bar{K}(t) = \\sum_i K_i(t) = \\sum_i K_i e^{r_i t} \\] and \\[\\bar{r}(t) = {{d \\over dt} \\bar{K}(t) \\over \\bar{K}(t)}\\] Let’s take derivatives and simplify, recalling definition of variance.

Heterogeneity pop growth We will extend to cover non-constant growth But Doesn’t tell us how much bigger \\(\\bar{K}(t)\\) is projection using constant aggregate rate \\(\\bar{r}(0)\\). Doesn’t give us a formula for time path of aggregate \\(\\bar{K}(t)\\) or \\(\\bar{r}(t)\\) Note: our homework will try to address some of this using Taylor approximation. 2.3.4 The Origin of Professor Wachter’s Poisson-Exponential Model Given a world with many sub-populations, each growing expontentially at their own rate, what can we say about the time-path of world population growth? From an email: Josh asks: Suppose we have a discrete mix of subpopulations growing at different intrinsic rates r whose maximum is r0. Is there a handy approximation for the growth path of the aggregate populations? The assumption of a discrete mix is essential here. Otherwise Tauberian theorems apply and, with a vanishingly small portion of the population close to the maximum growth rate, we do not obtain long-run exponential growth. I recommend modeling the discrete distribution of growth rates as a mixture of Poisson distributions. We are considering \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{mixture} \\bar{K}(t) = \\sum_i e^{r_i t} K_i(0). \\end{equation}\\] Ken suggests \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{ri_def} r_i = r_0 - s(\\lambda) \\cdot a, \\end{equation}\\] \\(r_0\\) growth rate of the fastest growing sub-population \\(s\\) a non-negative Poisson distributed integer \\(\\lambda\\) the parameter of the Poisson distribution (also it’s mean and variance) \\(a\\) gap between adjacent growth rates. Example: sub-populations have growth rates 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, \\(\\ldots\\) percent, then \\(r_0 = 0.03\\) and \\(a = 0.01\\). Sizes of sub-pops determined by Poisson dis’n 2.3.4.1 Closed-form result \\[ K(t) = K(0) e^{r_0 t} e^{-\\lambda (1 - e^{-at})}. \\] To derive: Write out mixture to get \\[ K(t) = K(0) e^{r_0 t} \\sum_i e^{-sat} f(s) \\] Substitute for \\(f(s)\\): \\(Pois ~ {\\lambda^s e^{-\\lambda} \\over s!}\\) Recognize that our mixture contains the series representation of \\(e^{-at}\\) Interpretation \\[ K(t) = K(0) e^{r_0 t} e^{-\\lambda (1 - e^{-at})}. \\] Dominant term contains the maximum population growth rate \\(r_0\\), Second term gives the diminishing effect of the sub-populations with smaller population growth rates over time. Some further analysis, What is the closed-form expression for \\(\\bar{r}(t)\\)? 2.3.5 Some commentary Poisson and Exponential ``fit’’ We’ll this complementarity again (e.g., with Gamma) Tractable models are super powerful for enhancing our understanding. But be careful. Avoid extremes: the model is right/wrong. A BIG caveat, are disaggregated models necessarily better? Some potential problems: Aggregate constraints? Interacting sub-populations? Illusion of precision? 2.4 Conclusions Heterogeneity as variation in risk (not just outcome) Constantly growing parts \\(\\neq\\) constantly growth whole Keyfitz result: Change in growth rate \\(=\\) variance of growth rates Poisson growth gives us a closed-form solution.

How do we compute pop survival, hazards, etc. How does life table of heterogeneous pop differ from baseline? 3.2.2 Let’s derive pop survival (Note: \\(\\bar{s} = \\bar{\\ell}\\)) Pop survival will be a weighted average of group survival curves \\[ \\bar{s}(x) = {p(z_1) s_1(x) + p(z_2) s_2(x) + \\ldots \\over p(z_1) + p(z_2) + \\ldots} \\] With continuous \\(z\\) (what are limits of integration?) \\[ \\bar{s}(x) = \\int s(x|z) p(z) \\, dz \\] Under Multiplicative Fixed Frailty use \\[ \\mu(x|z) = z \\mu_0(x) \\] to derive \\[\\bar{s}(x) = \\int s_0(x)^z p(z) \\,dz.\\] 3.2.3 Now population hazards (stepping stones) Definition of hazards: \\[ \\bar{\\mu}(x) = - {d \\over dx} \\log \\bar{s}(x) \\] \\[ \\bar{\\mu}(x) = \\mu_0(x) {\\int z s_0(x)^z p(z) \\, dz \\over \\int s_0(x)^z p(z) \\, dz} \\] \\[ \\bar{\\mu}(x) = \\mu_0(x) \\bar{z}(x) \\] Let’s fill in steps. 3.2.4 Rodriguez question Why isn’t population hazard a (simple) average of individual hazards? Answer: selected survival means that the distribution of frailty at age \\(x\\) differs from the starting frailty distribution at age \\(0\\). The rate of increase in hazards (AKA “LAR: Lifetable Aging Rate”) \\[ \\beta(x) = {d \\over dx} \\log \\mu(x) \\] Example: What is \\(\\beta(x)\\) for Gompertz: \\(\\mu(x) = a e^{bx}\\)?

Reversing the logic: if we see a characteristic changing with age, then we can estimate “\\({\\sigma^2}\\)” (I put in quotes because its the variance of the proportional effect of the observed characteristic.) 4.2 Selection and observed frailty in CenSoc We have a large matched sample from the 1940 census to Social Security death data observed from 1975 to 2004. This means that we can compute the survival curves of extinct cohorts and see how mortality selection changes the composition of the cohort as it ages. In this example, we use observed wage income in 1940 for the cohort born 1895 to 1900. We look at how wages of survivors increase with age as a result of selective mortality and we see if the gamma-frailty model can produce similar results. 4.2.1 Data Read in the data and transform the variables to what we want. We produce a variable \\(y\\) (in this case a standardized version of log wage income) to be transformed into a frailty score. ## read in dat library(data.table) dt &lt;- fread(&quot;/data/josh/CenSoc/censoc_bfdw.csv&quot;) ## Clean wage data dt[, incwage := INCWAGE] dt[incwage == 999998, incwage := NA] dt[incwage == 0, incwage := NA] hist_incwage &lt;- dt[, hist(incwage)] hist_ln_incwage &lt;- dt[, hist(log(incwage))] ## Do age at death for 1895-1900 cohorts dt[, age.at.death := dyear + dmonth/12 - (byear + bmonth/12)] my.dt &lt;- dt[byear %in% 1895:1900 &amp; dyear %in% 1975:2004] ## now limits to deaths younger than 105 my.dt[, max(age.at.death), by = byear] ## byear V1 ## 1: 1900 104.9167 ## 2: 1898 106.8333 ## 3: 1897 107.0833 ## 4: 1895 109.4167 ## 5: 1899 105.6667 ## 6: 1896 107.9167 nrow(my.dt[age.at.death &gt;= 105]) ## [1] 177 nrow(my.dt[floor(age.at.death) == 104]) ## [1] 253 ## now we have same age range for every cohort my.dt &lt;- my.dt[age.at.death &lt; 105] my.dt &lt;- my.dt[!is.na(incwage)] ## keep only non-missing Log-wages look reasonable, unimodal, kind of symmetric. We now center our variable to 0 before estimating the effect on mortality. Our model exponentiates this 0 to become 1, which is where we want our frailty measure to be centered. ## standardized log income ## log_inc_stan = log(y_orig) - mean(log(y_orig)) ## note: control for byear, since different ages in 1940 my.dt[, y_orig := incwage] my.dt[, log_inc := log(incwage)] my.dt[, log_inc_mean := mean(log_inc), by = byear] my.dt[, y := log_inc - log_inc_mean] hist_y &lt;- my.dt[, hist(y)] my.dt[, summary(y)] ## Min. 1st Qu.

And more after that. Is this what we would expect from our Gamma frailty model? 4.2.2 Estimation Estimate an observed frailty for each person, call this \\(z_{obs}\\) To do this we first use Cox regression to estimate the proportional effect of \\(y\\) on hazards. The Cox model has the form \\[ \\mu_i(x) = \\mu_0(x) e^{\\beta y} \\] We can then transform \\(y\\) into a frailty score \\(z_{obs}\\), letting \\[ z_{obs} = e^{\\hat\\beta y} \\] ## now get z&#39;s library(survival) my.dt[, event := 1] m &lt;- coxph(Surv(age.at.death, event) ~ y, data = my.dt) (summary(m)) ## Call: ## coxph(formula = Surv(age.at.death, event) ~ y, data = my.dt) ## ## n= 402797, number of events= 402797 ## ## coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) ## y -0.03073 0.96974 0.00177 -17.36 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 ## y 0.9697 1.031 0.9664 0.9731 ## ## Concordance= 0.512 (se = 0.001 ) ## Likelihood ratio test= 298 on 1 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## Wald test = 301.5 on 1 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## Score (logrank) test = 301.5 on 1 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) ## y -0.03073 0.96974 0.00177 -17.36 &lt;2e-16 *** ## so a 10% increase in income reduces mortality by .3% (quite a tiny effect!) beta &lt;- coef(m) The effect is very small.

Source: Barbi et al. (2018) What is the importance of plateaus? They encourage optimism that future progress against old-age mortality is feasible. Our bodies are not facing an endlessly mounting set of things going wrong. They point to commonalities with the life-course demography of other species. The shared genetic heritage of advanced organisms is permissive. For instance, we can compare human hazard to that of other species: Figure 6.2: Hazards across selected species. Source: Horiuchi (2003) 6.4.2 Gamma-Gompertz Fixed Frailty Hazards The Gamma-Gompertz model of Vaupel, Manton, and Stallard (1979) is familiar from this course and Chapter 8 of Essential Demographic Methods (Wachter 2014). Gamma Gompertz models are one way of generating plateaus for population hazards out of increasing individual hazards. We fit parameters to the data in Barbi et al. (2018) and look for a predicted plateau, starting from age 60 onwards. We need formulas for the individual hazard \\(h_x\\) , for the individual cumulative hazard \\(H_x\\), and for the aggregate population hazard \\(\\mu_x\\) implied by Gamma-distributed frailty with shape parameter \\(k\\) and rate parameter \\(\\theta = k\\). Does the prediction show a plateau? Does the level of the plateau fit plateau observed in the Italian cohorts over age 105? To answer these questions, we create the process below to calculate the aggregate population hazard function predicted from Gompertz hazards for individuals combined with a Gamma distribution for fixed proportional frailty, using parameters matched to the Italian cohort data for Barbi et al. (2018). # Parameters for Gompertz and Gamma beta &lt;- 0.088 # Gompertz slope parameter, Barbi et al. alpha60 &lt;- 0.01340671 # Gompertz intercept parameter at age 60 asymp &lt;- 0.620 # Observed asymptote, for comparisons in plots khat &lt;- 7.045455 # Gamma shape parameter, to fit plateau theta &lt;- 1/khat # Gamma rate parameter, for unit mean at 60 # Age range, starting to observe cohorts at age 60, reaching up to 130 xxx &lt;- c(0:200) # set of values of x, years past 60 age &lt;- 60 + xxx # age # Hazards: ### Gompertz formula to calculate individual hazards hx at x: hx &lt;- alpha60 *exp(beta*xxx) ##also noted as mu_0(x) in course material ### Individual cumulative hazard Hx formula Hx &lt;- cumsum(hx) ## another way of getting it is (a/b)(exp(bx)-1) ### Aggregate population hazard mu_x with Gamma frailty: mux &lt;- hx *khat/ (khat + Hx) Figure 6.3: Hazards and plateau with Gamma frailty Note that the x-axis shows the ages for the estimated Gompertz, that is for a population of ages 60 and above. \\(\\mu_x\\) appears to reach its own plateau due to the chosen parameters from the Gamma-Gompertz model. In this case, we get a plateau further along than in the italian case of Barbi et al. (2018). Gamma gompertz models are good at fitting plateaus mathematically but may not be aplicable with the data. 6.4.2.1 How does Gamma Gompertz Make a Plateau? Try alternative values for \\(k\\) and for \\(\\beta\\). Guess a formula for the level of the plateau. Here, we change the values of \\(\\beta\\) while fixing the \\(k\\) shape factor of the Gamma frailty distribution. As \\(\\beta\\) increases, the individual and population hazards rise (or shift upwards). For comparison, the third panel contains the \\(\\beta=0.088\\) and \\(k=7.045455\\) values used in the previous excercise. Figure 6.4: Changing values of beta in Gompertz hazards The following graphs fix \\(\\beta=0.088\\) but use different values of \\(k\\). Contrary to what happens when \\(\\beta\\) varies, when the shape parameter of the Gamma frailty distribution changes, only the population hazards appear to change. Population hazards expand upwards with increases in \\(k\\). The fourth panel uses the baseline values for \\(\\beta=0.088\\) and \\(k=7.045455\\). Figure 6.5: Changing values of k (Gamma shape parameter) This formula can be proved by showing that \\(h_{x}/H_{x}\\) goes to \\(\\beta\\) in a Gompertz model and plugging into the formula for Gamma Gompertz aggregate hazards. (Note for Josh: I don’t think Ken really explained this in class and I’m confused on how to answer this.) What happens to the mean frailty of survivors as \\(x\\) increases? What has to balance what in order for a plateau to appear? First, the mean frailty among survivors is the ratio of \\(\\mu_x\\) to \\(h_x\\). In other words, the mean frailty among the people that remain is the population hazard divided by the individual hazard. The mean frailty falls across ages, such that around 105 years, the mean frailty is about 0.5. It continues decreasing until it reaches a plateau of about 0.1 starting from age 130 onwards. Survivors past 130 have a low mean frailty but at a higher hazard, as seen by the plateau from previous graph. The plateau comes from the people that are low frailty but that die. This loss balances out the increase that everyone is experiencing. Selection is balancing senescence. Figure 6.6: Mean frailty 6.4.2.2 Troubles with Gamma Gompertz: Poor fits to observed cohort plateaus. Unrealistic mortality rates at younger ages for those who do survive out onto the plateau. (The frailty distribution reaches down to zero frailty). Individual centenarians still experience exponentially increasing hazards under the model. Why should frailty remain fixed across life? The model assumes rather than explains an underlying Gompertz. There is no full genetic or evolutionary story. 6.4.2.3 Mathematics of Frailty as a Gamma Random Variable: Probability density: \\(\\left(\\frac{\\theta^{k}}{\\Gamma(k)}\\right)z^{k-1}e^{-\\theta z}\\) Mean: \\(\\frac{k}{\\theta}\\) Variance: \\(\\frac{k}{\\theta^2}\\) \\(\\mathbb{E}e^{-ZH}= \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta H}\\right)^{k}\\) Exponential and Gamma Random Variables: When U has a uniform distribution on \\([0, 1]\\), then \\(Y = −log(U)/\\theta\\) has an exponential probability distribution on \\((0,\\infty)\\) with mean \\(1/\\theta\\) and variance \\(1/\\theta^2\\). The sum of \\(k\\) independent exponential random variables with the same mean \\(1/\\theta\\) has a gamma probability distribution with shape \\(k\\), scale \\(\\theta\\), rate \\(1/\\theta\\), mean \\(k/\\theta\\) and variance \\(k/(\\theta^2)\\). With an exponential variable Y, we have \\(\\mathbb{E}e^{-YH}=\\int e^{-yH}p(y)dy= \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+H}\\). Because expectation values of independent random variables multiply, with a gamma variable \\(Z = Y_1 + Y_2 + · · ·Y_k\\), we have \\(\\mathbb{E}e^{-ZH}= \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+H}\\right)^k\\). 6.4.2.4 Vaupel, Manton, and Stallard (1979) Lifelong Fixed Frailty Z. The Gamma distribution has \\(\\mathbb{E}e^{-ZH}= \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+H}\\right)^k\\) For starting mean frailty equal to 1, we have \\(k = \\theta\\). The aggregate population hazard is minus the slope of the logarithm of survivorship: \\(\\mu_x = -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k log(\\theta)- k log(\\theta+H_x)\\right)= \\left(\\frac{k}{\\theta+H_x}\\right)h_x\\) For the Gamma Gompertz, we insert Gompertz individual hazards \\(h_x\\) and individual cumulative hazards \\(H_x\\) into the formula. 6.4.3 Less Restrictive Frailty Models The key property of the Gamma Gompertz model is a frailty distribution that extends all the way down to zero frailty. With any initial frailty distribution that extends down to zero and looks like a Gamma near zero, the frailty distribution among survivors comes to look like a Gamma. If you do assume a Gamma distribution for frailty, then a plateau in the aggregate population hazard function entails an individual hazard function tending toward a Gompertz. However: Frailties near zero are unrealistic. With frailties bounded away from zero, plateaus in aggregate hazards require plateaus in individual hazards Plateaus in individual hazards can arise naturally, for instance from genetic models. Consider a “semi-circle” frailty whose probability density function is, for instance, \\(p(z) = (6)(z − 0.7)(1.3 − z)\\) on \\([0.7, 1.3]\\), zero else. If the individual hazard were Gompertz, would there be a plateau? Suppose the individual hazard were given by \\(\\frac{x}{(1 + x)}\\). Would there be a plateau in the individual hazard? If so, at what level? Would there be a plateau in the aggregate population hazard? If so, at what level? We ask what genetic processes might shape individual hazards into having stretches that look Gompertz and old-age forms looking like plateaus. 6.4.4 Mutation Accumulation, Gompertz Hazards with Plateaus We turn to alternative models with plateaus in individual hazards, not just in aggregate population hazards. The genetic evolutionary theory of “mutation accumulation” suggests one story to account both for Gompertzian increases over a stretch of adult ages and for plateaus beyond them. We each inherit genetic variants or “alleles” in our DNA originating in mutations thousands of generations in the past. Picture, say, the time of the cave painters, 40,000 B.C., when people died in their 30s and 40s and 50s rather than their 70s, 80s, and 90s, losing some of their chance to bear and raise offspring. 6.4.4.1 Mutation-Selection Equilibrium Go back to basic stable (stationary) population theory. Write \\(\\rho(a)\\) for the size of the group of individuals (e.g. women) who carry a certain mutant allele indexed by the letter \\(a\\). The NRR for members of the group is assumed to be \\(1 − S(a)\\) for some small “selective cost” \\(S(a)\\) due to effects of the “deleterious” allele. In the next generation, there are \\(\\rho(a)(1 − S(a))\\) daughters. There are also \\(\\nu(a)\\) new arrivals due to new mutations. The group keeps growing until it reaches equilibrium, when losses are balanced by new arrivals, and \\(\\rho(a) = \\rho(a)(1 − S(a)) + \\nu(a)\\). Then, \\(\\rho(a)\\) as a function of \\(S(a)\\) is: \\(\\rho(a)= \\frac{\\nu(a)}{S(a)}\\) 6.4.4.2 Deleterious Alleles with Age-Specific Effects In our setting, many deaths come from external threats regardless of age, a background level of “extrinsic mortality” with constant hazard \\(\\lambda\\). To keep the story as simple as possible, picture a mutant allele that has a small bad effect on survival only at an “age of onset” \\(a\\). It raises the hazard of the individual who carries it by an amount \\(\\delta\\) in the age interval \\(a\\) to \\(a + 1\\). Picture a constant level of fertility from age 20 onward, set to make the NRR equal to 1 for women who carry no mutant alleles. Take, for example, \\(\\lambda = 0.080\\), \\(\\delta= 0.002\\), and \\(\\nu(a) = 0.020/50\\) for any \\(a \\geq 20\\). For each separate choice of age of onset \\(a\\), find and plot the equilibrium size \\(rho(a)\\) as a function of \\(a\\). Here, we explore a genetic process which can generate a plateau in individual hazard functions. In particular, this is the case where a harmful mutant allele increases the hazard function of those that carry such allele with onset only in a single age interval. \\(\\rho(a)\\) increases exponentially, this comes from the exponential survival. This graph tells us, the number of people that survive when the mutation is triggered at a given age. So at age 70, about 1400 people survive but if the mutation hit at age 20, nobody would survive. Figure 6.7: $ ho(a)$ as a function of age 6.4.4.3 Allele Counts and Individual Hazards Suppose that the alleles carried by an individual are a random sample of the alleles present in the population, so that \\(\\rho(a)\\) can be reinterpreted as the mean number of alleles of type \\(a\\). Then the hazard for an individual at age \\(a\\) will look on average like the curve \\(\\lambda + \\rho(a) \\times \\delta\\). Does this curve resemble a Gompertz hazard? What about a Makeham hazard, that is, a Gompertz hazard plus a constant? This hazard looks like a Makeham hazard (Gompertz plus a constant). hxx &lt;- lambda + bigrho*delta Figure 6.8: Hazard after exposure to allele The background intrinsic mortality \\(\\lambda\\) comes from the environment, not from the DNA. What might happen to \\(\\lambda\\) as we move from the time of the cave painters to the time of the moon landings? 6.4.4.4 Plateaus in Allele Counts Suppose, now, that each mutant allele raises the hazard by another small amount \\(\\epsilon= 0.0005\\) at all ages beyond 20, along with its special effect on raising the hazard by \\(\\delta\\) at age \\(a\\). Find and plot the size \\(\\rho(a)\\) of the carriers of a at equilibrium under this new form of action. Is there an appearance of a plateau at high ages? Is it plausible to expect some fixed cost along with an age-specific effect from mildly deleterious mutant alleles? Here is the case were a deleterious mutant allele imposes a fixed cost of size \\(\\epsilon\\) as well as adding an increment of size \\(\\delta\\) to the hazard in age interval \\(a\\). There appears to be a plateau on the survivors after the onset of the mutation at age \\(a\\) when we add a fixed cost to the mutation, even if it is happening late in the reproductive cycle. Figure 6.9: $ ho(a)$ as a function of age 6.4.4.5 Questions for Further Study What about the effect of each allele on the selective cost of all the other alleles? Looking across species, under this account would we expect some relationship between the level of extrinsic background mortality and the steepness of the slope of a Gompertz increase in mortality with age? In our calculation we let mortality over the age of 50 continue to reduce the “NRR”. Why might survival beyond ages of childbearing have an effect on generational replacement? We carry in our DNA a load of mutant alleles shaped by natural selection over hundreds and thousands of generations. Why might it be that effects of those alleles that were once lethal in mid-adult life could now be influencing rates of mortality late in life for us? 6.5 Key points Plateaus are significant information for demographers who try to predict future progress against old-age mortality. Gompertz discouragement – Plateau encouragement Gamma-Gompertz models offer one explanation for plateaus, but no explanation for Gompertz acceleration, which is simply assumed. -In frailty models, plateaus come out of the specialness of survivors. The mathematics treats mixtures of survivorship. Evolutionary genetic models aim to explain both Gompertz acceleration and old-age plateaus. In the mutation-accumulation story, plateaus are present in the hazard functions of individuals, shaped by inherited genetic load. In demography, survivorship is ALWAYS an exponential function of cumulative hazards. In genetic stories, this exponential is the source of the exponential in the Gompertz formula. The study of hazards at extreme age may inform our understanding of hazards at younger ages. References "],

Heterogeneous models reveal what’s “really” going on. (Or do they?). Until the past sections, population hazards mislead. However in this section, homogeneous fertility misleads. We now reverse perspectives: We see differences we see in genotypes, in lineages, in names. These could be due to “real” differences (heterogeneity). But they could also be due to luck: everyone is the same but stochastic outcomes differ. Our models of individual-level randomness will have predicted dynamics, which are themselves interesting but can also be used as a “null” to compare to observations. 7.2.1 Fertility postponement, a very simple example Baseline A population has a history of 1 birth per day When women turn age 25, they have a daughter. This gives us a constant stream of births, 365 per year. Postponement Starting on Jan. 1, 2020, everyone postpones childbearing an additional month, until they are aged 25 1/12. How many births will there be in 2020? How many births in 2021? As everybody postpones childbearing for a month, then the first birth of 2020 occurs on February 1st so that 31 babies have not been born by then. This means that during 2020 there are \\(365-31=334\\) births. For this year, births and total fertility rate decrease. However, the postponement doesn’t affect the birth stream in 2021 as there will still be one birth per day, even if in the absence of postponing these some of the births should’ve occured in 2020. 7.2.2 Continuous postponement, a shiny simulation To answer these questions, we can use the following shiny app. \\(R(t)\\) Cumulative postponment \\(r(t)\\) Incremental postponement \\(r(t) = R&#39;(t)\\) What is a formula for recovering original birth stream? \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{B}_{orig} &amp;= B_{obs} \\times (1 + R&#39;(t)) \\\\ \\text{or}\\\\ \\hat{B}_{orig} &amp;= B_{obs} \\times 1/ \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right]? \\end{align}\\] Note: this idea of ``recovering original’’ is one way to think about tempo adjustment. We can think of the original version as that which should have ocurred in the absence of postponement. Intuitively, it should be higher than the observed birth stream, but how much larger? The table below shows an example of how to recover the original births where each formula refers to the equations above. r(t) B(obs) B(orig) formula 1 B(orig) formula 2 0.1 91 100.1 101.1111 0.2 84 100.8 105.0000 0.3 77 100.1 110.0000 0.4 72 100.8 120.0000 The correct formula is equation 2. NOTE: is this correct? If so, why? 7.3 Period Shifts: Bongaarts and Feeney’s model In a bigger microsimulation Each period will have births across a range of ages We’ll randomly generate the original planned birthdays Then we’ll shift by a continuous function \\(R(t)\\). The birth rate of women, \\(f(a,t)\\), aged \\(a\\) in period \\(t\\) is: \\[ f(a,t) = f_0(a - R(t)) (1- R&#39;(t)) q(t) \\] Where \\(f_0\\): constant baseline schedule (can be normalized to sum to 1). \\(q(t)\\): period intensity parameter: “quantum” \\(R(t)\\): cumulative shift. An example \\[ f(a,t) = f_0(a - R(t)) (1- R&#39;(t)) q(t) \\] \\(R_{2019} = 3\\) \\(R&#39;_{2019} = .1\\) \\(q(2019) = 1\\) Give an expression for \\(f(28,2019)\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned} f(28,2019) &amp;= f_{0}(28-3)\\times(1-0.1)\\times(1) \\\\ &amp; = (0.9)f_{0}(25) \\end{aligned} \\] Therefore, the fertility rate for a 28 year-old in 2019 would be 0.9 of the baseline fertility rate at age 25. Another way of thinking about it is that had there been no postponement, the fertility rate that we are observing in 2019 for this 28 year-old would actually be similar to that of a 25 year old. Small changes in the stock can have huge effect in the flows. 7.3.1 A derivation: due to Rodriguez NOTE: not sure what the reference is here Assume no quantum effects (i.e, no \\(q(t)\\)). Take a cohort with cumulative fertility \\[ F_0(a) = \\int_0^a f(x) \\,dx \\] Now put in shifts so that observed fertility is from an age \\(R(t)\\) years earlier. (“28” is the new “25”!) \\[ F(a,t) = F_0(a - R(t)) = F_0(a - R(c + a)) \\] Differentiate with respect to age (which for a cohort is also time \\(t\\)), using chain rule \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d }{dt}F(a,t)= f(a,t) &amp;= F&#39;_{0}(a-R(c+a))\\times(1-R&#39;(c+a)) \\\\ &amp;= f_0(a - R(t)) \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right] \\end{aligned}\\] Let’s re-notate our constant quantum result \\[ f_0(a,t | R(t) ) = f_0(a - R(t)) \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right] \\] Then we can incorporate period quantum on the shifted surface: \\[ f(a,t) = f_0(a,t | R(t) ) q(t) = f_0(a - R(t)) \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right]q(t) \\] Note: If we vary quantum before shifts, then \\(q(t)\\) will bleed into neighboring years. (a small effect, but makes model messier). NOTE: I don’t understand this, could you explain Josh? Tempo-adjusted TFR: counter-factual, TFR in absence of timing changes \\[ TFR(t) = \\int_0^\\infty f(a,t) \\, da \\] Substituting our shifted birth rates with quantum \\[ \\begin{aligned} TFR(t) &amp;= \\int_0^\\infty f_0(a - R(t)) \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right]q(t) da \\\\ &amp;=\\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right]q(t) \\int_0^\\infty f_0(a - R(t)) da \\\\ &amp;= TFR_0 \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right] q(t)\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Without loss of generality, define \\(TFR_0 = 1\\), then \\[ q(t) = \\frac{TFR(t)} {1 - R&#39;(t)} \\equiv TFR^*(t) \\] The observed \\(TFR(t)\\) deflated by the rate of change (\\(1 - R&#39;(t)\\)) is the BF formula. How do period schedules change? \\[ f(a,t) = f_0(a - R(t)) \\left[1 - R&#39;(t)\\right]q(t) \\] What is \\[ \\begin{aligned} {\\partial \\over \\partial t} \\log f(a,t) &amp;= ?\\\\ \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{d}{dt}log(f_{0}(a-R(t))) + \\frac{d}{dt}log(1-R&#39;(t)) + \\frac{d}{dt}log(q(t)) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{-f&#39;_{0}(a-R(t)) R&#39;(t)}{f_{0}(a-R(t))} - \\frac{R&#39;&#39;(t)}{1-R&#39;(t)}+ \\frac{q&#39;(t)}{q(t)} \\end{aligned} \\] If we sketch this, where the age is on the x-axis, then the last two components affect the intercept of the curve. If births are postponed, \\(R&#39;(t)&gt;0\\) but if they are actually advanced then \\(R&#39;(t)&lt;0\\), which affects the slope of $ {t} f(a,t)$. Uniform shifts BF model assumes all ages shift by \\(R(t)\\). BF model assumes all ages rise or fall by same quantum \\(q(t)\\) Violating these assumptions means change in mean age will not just reflect “tempo”. Example: What happens if people have fewer higher order births? BF recommendation for achieving uniformity Separate estimates for each birth order, and then combine: \\[ TFR^*(t) = \\sum_i TFR_i^*(t) = \\sum_i {TFR_i(t) \\over 1 - r_i(t)} \\] This will protect against order-specific quantum effects. 7.4 An Application to the United States Tempo adjustment of US fertility using HFD data using Bongaarts-Feeney formula: Read in data and format into an array.

Here is a closeup Figure 7.2: Observed and tempo-adjusted TFRs Now let’s look at turbulence around WWII Figure 7.3: Change in fertility rates around WWII From 1945 to 1946, fertility goes up a lot, but more at younger ages.

The baby boom appears to initially be even greater than observed when we take into account birth order, but then it fall more than observed. Finally, the baby bust was not as bad as it seemed. Figure 7.5: TFR by parities using HFD data 7.4.1 Conclusions Baby boom smaller if we account for “pre-ponement”. Fertility lull in 1970s and 80s disappears if we account for “postponement”. Birth order disaggregation improves estimates of shifts from changes in mean age What happened with the recession? 7.5 Two Americas Let’s look at births (all orders).

However with time, the AFR seems to become bimodal. So what is happening here? Are there two underlying groups of women that experience different fertility rates.

Do you start out in one and end up in the other? Do you stay in one your whole life? How do we project forward?

Now, we’re switching gears: Stochastic not deterministic In small populations, randomness matters. (Even when risks are homogeneous.) We will look at branching processes (“parents producing children”), next Fisher-Wright (“children choosing parents”), and then historical reconstruction from contemporary diversity (“coalescent”). 8.2.1 Very brief history of Branching Processes Bienaymé’s lost notes Old motivation: Galton and Watson’s: to see if elites were dying out because of “degeneration” Contemporary motivation: evolution and neutral genetic change. What is the chance that a mutant will survive? War-time motivation: to see how to build the bomb (chain reactions) Sociological: Anywhere “incipient dynamics” matter (will all of S. Korea be “Kim”?) Can we get variance of reproductive success from name disambiguation? It will give us a headstart on other (less realistic but easier) “drift” models. 8.2.2 Applicability to the Coronavirus? Yes and no. Perhaps the beginning, with first few cases. But once scale gets large, we’ll see that deterministic dynamics take over. One lesson: beyond \\(R_0\\). 8.2.3 Simulated examples and the questions they raise Here are the chances, \\(p_k\\), that the first carrier passes on the virus to \\(k\\) people \\(k\\) \\(p_k\\) 0 .3 1 .4 2 .3 What is \\(R_0\\), (aka \\(m\\))? This is the expected number of infected cases: \\[\\begin{aligned} R_{0} &amp; = 0\\times 0.3 + 1\\times 0.4 + 2\\times 0.3 \\\\ &amp; = 1 \\end{aligned}\\] NOTE: is this correct? Now assume that people will infect \\(k\\) other people based on a random number, for instance the last 4 digits of their phone number. \\(k\\) \\(p_k\\) digits 0 .3 0-2 1 .4 3-5 2 .3 6-9 Let’s diagram one chance outcome, using my number “(xxx) xxx-9056”. As each of the four digits is associated with a probability of infecting more people, they can be seen as different the carrier generations. For instance, the first carrier has a probability \\(p_k=0.3\\) of infecting \\(k=2\\) other people. So that first carrier may infect 2.7 people, (3 for simplicity). Each of these three people will have a \\(p_k=0.2\\) of each infecting \\(k=0\\) people. Since they don’t infect anybody then there are no further carrier generations. In the table, we include their rows but the expected number of infected people is still 0 because the spreading stopped in generation 2. carrier generation # random digit \\(p_k\\) expected # infected 1 9 0.3 \\(2\\times 0.3 = 2.7\\) 2 0 0.2 \\(0\\times 0.3 = 0\\) 3 5 0.4 0 4 6 0.4 0 NOTE: does this sound reasonable? 8.2.4 What is a (Bienayme)-Galton-Watson branching process? \\(p_k\\): Each individual in each generation reproduces independently, following same offspring distribution, with \\(p_k\\) as the probability of having \\(k\\) offspring. \\(Z_n\\): The si\\(Z\\)e of the \\(n\\)’th generation \\(Z_n\\). (\\(Z_1 \\equiv 1\\)) \\(p_0 &gt; 0\\): Some non-zero probability of no children. Variance: None of the \\(p_k\\) are 1 Galton’s original question Some questions What is the chance \\(d\\) of eventual extinction (no “outbreak”)? Or, what is the distribution of surviving family sizes? What are the aggregate properties of many branching processes? (Mean growth, variance, time-paths, eventual size)? 8.3 Simulations of parents having children k = 0:2 #number of possible children p0 = .3; p1 = .3; p2 = .4; p_k = c(p0, p1, p2) #probabilities of having k children Z1 = 1 #initial cohort size set.seed(9) kids.of.Z1 = sample(x = k, size = Z1, replace = T, prob = p_k) Z2 = sum(kids.of.Z1) kids.of.Z2 = sample(x = k, size = Z2, replace = T, prob = p_k) Z3 = sum(kids.of.Z2) kids.of.Z3 = sample(x = k, size = Z3, replace = T, prob = p_k) Z4 = sum(kids.of.Z3) Generation # Person ID Total children Generation size 1 1.0 2 1 2 2.1 2 2 2 2.2 2 2 3 3.1 2 4 3 3.2 1 4 3 3.3 2 4 3 3.4 2 4 4 4.1 0 7 4 4.2 0 7 4 4.3 0 7 4 4.4 0 7 4 4.5 0 7 4 4.6 0 7 4 4.7 0 7 Here’s a more visual representation. However, we can extend the number of generations in a function: #A function branch &lt;- function(n_max = 30, pk = c(p0, p1, p2), Z1 = 1) { Z.vec &lt;- rep(NA, n_max) # n_max handles the total number of generations Z.vec[1] &lt;- Z1 for (i in 1:(n_max-1)) { Z.vec[i+1] &lt;- sum(sample(x = k, size = Z.vec[i], replace = T, prob = p_k)) } return(Z.vec) # returns a vector of the number of children at every generation } Sometimes generations die out: set.seed(19) ; branch() ## [1] 1 2 2 4 5 2 2 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 set.seed(99) ; branch() ## [1] 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Let’s see what happens with 20 trials (up to 30 generations). Not all generations go extinct here. n_trials = 20 n_gen = 30 k = 0:2 #number of possible children p0 = .3; p1 = .3; p2 = .4; p_k = c(p0, p1, p2) #probabilities of having k children Z1 = 1 #initial cohort size Z.mat &lt;- matrix(NA, n_trials, n_gen) set.seed(131) for (i in 1:n_trials) Z.mat[i,] &lt;- branch(n_max = n_gen) Figure 8.1: Generation size How many survive (out of 20)? log-scale Figure 8.2: Generation sizes (log-scale) ## surviving ## extinct survive ## 0.5 0.5 How would you discribe the time path of the surviving lines? Let’s extend the number of generations to observe any long-term trends. n_trials = 20; n_gen = 100 Z.mat &lt;- matrix(NA, n_trials, n_gen) set.seed(131) for (i in 1:n_trials) Z.mat[i,] &lt;- branch(n_max = n_gen) Figure 8.3: Generation sizes (log-scale) over many generations What does this remind you of? (Hint: “Leslie”). (See Harris figure) NOTE: Josh, which Harris figure? 8.4 The Probability Generating Function: Our mathematical tool “Extinction” vs “breakout” We see that in a super-critical (\\(m &gt; 1\\)) branching process, if a line can survive a few generations and reach a large enough size, it will grow exponentially. What happens if \\(m &lt; 1\\), if \\(m = 1\\)? Discuss. \\[ h(z) = p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2 + \\ldots \\] The PGF “keeps book” on the probabilities. The chance of \\(k\\) is the coefficient on \\(z^k\\). \\(h(0)= p_{0}\\) \\(h(1)= p_{0} + p_{1}\\) \\(h&#39;(1)= p_{1} + 2p_{2}\\) The story of two brothers. A father has two sons. The probability generating function of their children combined is: \\[ h(z)^2 = (p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2) \\times (p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2) \\] If we multiply it out we get: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left[h(z)\\right]^2 = &amp; p_0^2 + p_0 p_1 z + p_0 p_2 z^2 +\\\\ &amp; p_1 z p_0 + p_1^2 z^2 + p_1 p_2 z^3 + \\\\ &amp; p_2 z^2 p_0 + p_2 z^3 p_1 + p_2^2 z^4 \\\\ &amp; = p_0^2 + (2p_0 p_1 )z + (2p_0 p_2 + p_1^2)z^2 + (2p_1 p_2)z^3 + p_2^2 z^4 \\end{aligned} \\] The coefficients on \\(z^0, z^1, \\ldots\\) tell us the probability that the sons will have \\(k=0,1,2,3,4\\) sons. What is the probability generating function for the distribution of grandsons? A man has two sons, with probability \\(p_2\\), so PGF in that case is \\(p_2 [h(z)]^2\\). But let’s sum over all possible numbers of sons. \\[ p_0 + p_1 h(z) + p_2 [h(z)]^2 + p_3 [h(z)]^3 + \\ldots \\] This is the cumulative probability of drawing \\(k\\) children within a generation of size \\(Z\\) Which is? \\[ h(h(z)) \\] Can show PGF for the n’th generation is \\[ h(h(h ... \\mbox{$n$ times} h(z))) = h_n(z) \\] For instance, let’s get \\(h_2(z) = h(h(z))\\) for $ h(z) = p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2$ \\[\\begin{aligned} h(h(z)) = &amp; p_0 + p_1 \\left[p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2\\right] + p_2 \\left[p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2\\right]^2\\\\ = &amp; p_0 + p_1 p_0 + p_1^2 z + p_1 p_2 z^2 + p_2p_0^2 + (2p_0 p_1 p_2)z + (2p_0 p_2^2 + p_2p_1^2)z^2 + (2p_1 p_2^2)z^3 + p_2^3 z^4 \\end{aligned}\\] 8.5 Extinction Extinction “Extinction is forever.”: So, the probability \\(d_n\\) of extinction by generation \\(n\\) can never decline over time. (Must it always rise?) Recursive extinction Is non-extinction “forever”?: If \\(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} = d(\\infty) &lt; 1\\), then this says there’s a chance \\(1 - d(\\infty)\\) of eternal persistence. We’ll try to figure out more about what this means. If the probability of a female line going extinct in \\(n\\) generations is \\(d_n\\), then this is equivalent to her daughter(s) line(s) going extinct in \\(n-1\\) generations. With \\(p_k\\) chance of having \\(k\\) daughters, we have \\[ d_n = p_0 + p_1 d_{n-1} + \\mbox{What is next term in series?} \\] What can we do with \\[ d_n = h(d_{n-1})? \\] Well, remember that \\(d_n\\) is non-decreasing, and that it’s maximum can be no greater than \\(1.0\\). When \\(d_n\\) reaches it’s limit, say \\(d\\), we won’t need generational subscripts, \\(d\\) will be constant, and will obey \\[ d = h(d) \\] Thus, an amazing result: the probability of ultimate extinction is when the argument equals the PGF of the argument. Can \\(d = 1\\), can \\(d &lt; 1\\) Try \\(d = 1\\). What happens? If we were to find a solution less than 1.0, how would we interpret that? Three cases z = seq(0, 1.6, .01) pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) &lt;- 0:2 d &lt;- pk[&quot;0&quot;] for (i in 1:10) { d &lt;- pk[&quot;0&quot;] + pk[&quot;1&quot;]*d + pk[&quot;2&quot;]*d^2 } ## super-critical hz = pk[&quot;0&quot;] + pk[&quot;1&quot;]*z + pk[&quot;2&quot;]*z^2 plot.fun &lt;- function(z, hz) { plot(z, hz, type = &quot;l&quot;, ylim = c(0,1.6), ylab = &quot;h(z)&quot;, yaxs = &quot;i&quot;, xaxs = &quot;i&quot;, axes = F) axis(1, at = seq(0, 1.5, .5)) axis(2, at = seq(0, 1.5, .5)) abline(0,1, col = &quot;grey&quot;) lines(z, hz) axis(2, at = pk[&quot;0&quot;], labels = &quot;p0&quot;, col.axis = &quot;red&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 1, las = 2) } par(mfrow = c(1,3), pty = &quot;s&quot;) plot.fun(z,hz) points(c(d, 1),c(d, 1)) title(&quot;Super-critical (m &gt; 1) \\n 2 roots&quot;) ## sub-critical pk = c(.3, .55, .15); names(pk) &lt;- 0:2 hz = pk[&quot;0&quot;] + pk[&quot;1&quot;]*z + pk[&quot;2&quot;]*z^2 plot.fun(z,hz) title(&quot;Sub-critical (m &lt; 1) \\n 1 root&quot;) points(1,1) ## critical pk = c(.3, .4, .3); names(pk) &lt;- 0:2 hz = pk[&quot;0&quot;] + pk[&quot;1&quot;]*z + pk[&quot;2&quot;]*z^2 plot.fun(z, hz) title(&quot;Critical (m = 1), \\n 1 root&quot;) points(1,1) We can prove by answering: What is \\(h&#39;(1)\\)? What is \\(h(0)\\)? Is \\(h&#39;&#39;(z) &gt; 0\\)? In the following cobwed diagram (like a staircase), we can see the values of \\(h(p_0)\\), \\(h(h(p_0))\\), \\(h(h(h(p_0)))\\), \\(\\ldots\\)? The orange dot is \\(h(p_0)\\). The purple dot is \\(h(h(p_0))\\). The blue dot is \\(h(h(h(p_0)))\\). The points would converge until we reach the intersection between \\(h(z)\\) and the diagonal. So how do we actually get \\(d\\)? Take the case where \\(p_0 = .3\\), \\(p_1 = 0\\), and \\(p_3 = .7\\) (the one I just plotted). Can do some algebra Or we can recursively iterate on the computer. Numerical recursion: below we start at the first value of the probability vector and sequentially try exploring values of \\(h(z)\\) until we find one that doesn’t change as much. We illustrate the case for up to 20 iterations. pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) &lt;- 0:2 ## our example d &lt;- pk[&quot;0&quot;] # initial value for (i in 1:20) { d &lt;- pk[&quot;0&quot;] + pk[&quot;1&quot;]*d + pk[&quot;2&quot;]*d^2 if (i %in% c(1,2,19,20)) print(paste(i, d)) } ## [1] &quot;1 0.363&quot; ## [1] &quot;2 0.3922383&quot; ## [1] &quot;19 0.428565882081349&quot; ## [1] &quot;20 0.428568100698915&quot; - Did we get the right value? Apparently, yes! The green lines take as vertical and horizontal values our $d=0.428568100698915$ Extinction and non-extinction revisited If \\(m &gt; 1\\), there exists \\(d\\) bigger than 0 and less than unity. This means there’s some positive chance of extinction. But also some chance of never-extinction. (What form does never-extinction take?)

Families that die out didn’t have to have low \\(NRR\\). Just because most new viruses don’t break out, doesn’t mean they aren’t potentially dangerous (\\(R_0 &gt;&gt; 1.0\\)). A model that corresponds our mental model of running a generative process forward. (cf. Fisher-Wright) Bad When offspring of 1 depends on offspring of other (e.g., brothers inheriting a farm) When resource constraints slow growth rates (e.g., Malthus: fertility of next gen depends on fertility of last; SIR model in disease spread) Analysis. PGF is powerful but still we often have to deal with listing all possibilities. Big populations – law of large numbers means randomness doesn’t matter. 8.7 The distribution of offspring of all generations Means of offspring in generation \\(n\\) Is it “meaningful”? It tells you about the average number of offspring but it might be a skewed distributions because of the large number of zeros. We’ll show that unconditional mean is the expectation of random sum, which in this case is the expectation of a product. \\[ \\mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n \\] What if \\(m = 1\\)? Mean size of surviving lines? Total probability is sum of conditional probabilities, times the chance of each condition: \\[ \\mathbb{E} Z_n = \\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0) P(Z_n &gt; 0) + \\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n = 0) P(Z_n = 0) \\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0) P(Z_n &gt; 0)\\) is the expected size given no extinction and \\(\\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n = 0) P(Z_n = 0)\\) is the expected size given extinction. What is mean size of surviving lines? That is, we want to find \\(\\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0)\\) Hint 1: \\(P(Z_n = 0) = d_n\\) So \\(P(Z_n &gt; 0) = 1- d_n\\) Hint 2: \\(\\mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n\\) Also note that by definition, \\(\\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n = 0)=0\\) \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n = &amp; \\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0) (1- d_n) + (0)d_n\\\\ m^n = &amp; \\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0) (1- d_n)\\\\ \\mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n &gt; 0) =&amp;\\frac{m^n}{(1- d_n)} \\end{aligned} \\] Let’s check our result using simulation for 1000 trials.

This is “fixation”, when one type becomes universal. 9.2.1 Another cell phone example Let’s simulate and draw lines Gen 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Gen 2 Gen 3 What will happen? 9.3 Mutation Simulation fwm &lt;- function(N, n_gen, mu = 0) ## mu != 4/N { ## simulate fisher-wright (with mutations) x &lt;- paste(1:N) ## starting types A &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = n_gen, ncol = N) for (i in 1:n_gen) { A[i,] &lt;- x x &lt;- sample(x, size = N, replace = T) x &lt;- mut(x, mu) x } return(A) ## matrix of types, each line a generation. } mut &lt;- function(x, mu) { ## m, the individuals that mutate m &lt;- which(rbinom(length(x), 1, mu) == 1) if (length(m) == 0) ## if no-one mutates return(x) ## add a suffix to their ID, so it will be unique (infinite alleles) suffix &lt;- 10000*round(runif(length(m)),4) x[m] &lt;- paste0(x[m], &quot;.&quot;, suffix) x } Trying it out set.seed(1) fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 2, mu = 0) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;10&quot; ## [2,] &quot;9&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;5&quot; fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 2, mu = 0) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;10&quot; ## [2,] &quot;5&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;10&quot; Trying it out some more set.seed(1) A &lt;- fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 20, mu = 0) tt &lt;- table(A, row(A)) ## count types by row ptt &lt;- prop.table(tt, 2) ## proportions matplot(t(ptt), type = &#39;l&#39;, lty = 1, main = &quot;FW simu&quot;) text(x = 4, y = jitter(ptt[,4]), rownames(ptt), col = 1:6) Questions: What happens at time 15?

Answer for us is \\[ \\bar{T}_{fixed} = 2 \\cdot N \\] Note: Biologists say \\(4 N_e\\). See Wikipedia “Genetic drift” Simulation of time to fixation T.vec &lt;- NULL all.the.same &lt;- function(x){length(unique(x)) == 1} set.seed(10) for (i in 1:100) { A &lt;- fwm(N = 100, n_gen = 1000,mu = 0) extinction_time = min(row(A)[apply(A, 1, all.the.same)]) T.vec[i] &lt;- extinction_time } mean(T.vec) ## [1] 202.89 9.4.1 Path to fixation: a measure of homogeneity/heterogeneity Chance that two randomly drawn individuals are of same type. \\[ G = \\sum_i p_i^2 \\] If we have two types, \\(p_1 = \\pi\\) , \\(p_2 = 1-\\pi\\)?

Starting point for coalescent 9.7.1 Some potential criticism While we can’t reject that there’s some parameterization of FW that gives us similar disn, this doesn’t mean that we’ve found the right mechanism. (Just that we can’t reject it). What are some other tests of this mechanism? Markov assumption. We could see if each frequency really followed random walk. Perhaps we could see if variances were scaled to frequencies correctly. References "],

Time to (T)MRCA Simulation: Inferring population size An application of Coalescent Theory 10.2 Big picture: The Coalescent: Expectations of the Past Coalescent theory is not a theory. It’s a model for the probability of different histories “the” coalescent is a bit confusing. We’re not inferring the actual history of common ancestry, just the probabilities An actual “picture” Top panel is a Fisher-Wright instance, ordered so that lines don’t cross. Haplotype is a sequence (we are diploids, each contributing 2 haplotypes). But let’s just think of each line as an individual, for now. We can find The Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) of sample (dark purple). Who and when would the MRCA of the top two individuals be? Our sample \\(\\neq\\) even all extant descendants of the MRCA. What does this mean? Our sample \\(\\neq\\) all of the descendants of the MRCA. What does this mean? If we chose two descendants at random, would we always get same MRCA? When we model coalescence we are thinking backwards in time. 10.3 Our first question: When was MRCA? If we sample two individuals (today), how long ago was their MRCA?\\ (Note: question is not “who”) Our answer will in terms of the probability of MRCA being 1 generation ago, 2 generations ago, etc. We’ll assume Fisher-Wright (constant N, each gen randomly picks parents) The answer is surprisingly simple Let’s assume we have \\(N\\) lines in Fisher-Wright (Note: I’m not using \\(2N\\).) The chance that two sampled people have same parent is \\(1/N\\), right? Thus \\(P(T_{MRCA} = 1) = 1/N\\). What is $P(T_{MRCA} = 2) = $? What is $P(T_{MRCA} = n) = $? Let’s go to continuous time (reasonable if pop is big and time scale is long). Hazard of coalescence = \\(c = 1/N\\). Probability of coalescence at time \\(t\\) = \\(\\ell(t) h(t) = e^{-ct} c\\) What is expected time of coalescence? Think life expectancy. \\(E(T_{MRCA})\\) if two samples: \\(1/c = 1/(1/N) = N\\) Let’s simulate 1 time, without random seed, letting N = 40, ngen = 200, mu = 0 Average over 100 FW simulations What is variance of outcome? Is it what we would expect from exponential? 10.4 Mutation and inference of TMRCA and \\(N\\) Say mutations occur at a constant rate \\(\\mu\\) (\\(10^{-8}\\)?) Each year we would expect \\(\\mu\\) mutations, and over \\(T\\) years we would expect \\(T\\mu\\) mutations. Say we observe that two people differ at \\(k\\) sites of the genome. When was TMRCA? How big is the population? Picture (\\(\\Lambda\\)) Tree length = \\(2T\\) Expected number of mutations: \\[ E(k) = E(2T\\mu) = \\bar{T} 2 \\mu \\] Since, \\[ \\bar{T} = E(TMRCA) = N \\] If we observe on average \\(\\bar{k}\\) mutations, then \\[ E(k) = N 2 \\mu \\rightarrow \\hat{N} = {\\bar{k} \\over 2 \\mu} \\] 10.5 Inference of population size, simulation We do FW with mutations Average pairwise differences Divide by \\(2\\mu\\) to get our estimate We can repeat a bunch of times and see average estimate converges to the truth Coalescence of a sample of \\(n\\) individuals This is covered on pages 42 and 43 of Gillespie We’ll just do one quick example, accepting the result A sample of 3: Note we’re using \\(N\\) (instead of \\(2N\\)) Question: If we sample 4, how much of time to TMRCA is do we have 4 branches, 3 branches, and 2 branches? 10.6 Conclusions We defined the coalescent as the stochastic process going back in time to common ancestors For constant population size, we proved that time to coalescence for a sample pair is exponential. We showed (math and simulation) that \\(E(T) = N\\). We showed that we could estimate \\(N\\) from observed mutations if we knew the mutation rate \\end{frame} 10.7 An application of coalescent theory Application to making inferences about the real history of human populations. Caveat: We’re still using \\(N\\) (not \\(2N\\)) as the number of haploids 10.7.1 Coalesence when population is changing Ee said hazard of coalescence was \\(h = c = 1/N\\). What is hazard of coalesence in one generation for two different populations: \\(N = 1000\\)? \\(N = 2000\\)? What if within the same population \\(N(t) = 1000\\) and \\(N(t+1) = 2000\\)? (Hint: we still follow FW in allowing children to choose their parents.) If the population size changes over time \\(N(t)\\), then hazards of coalescence in will change too: \\(h(t) = 1/N(t)\\).

Our approach Say we have \\(i\\) pairs of haploids We then compute how many pairwise differences there are, but instead of computing \\(\\bar{k}\\), we keep the distributional information \\(k_i\\). Each \\(k_i\\) implies a \\(T_i\\) We then have a set of ``death times’’ (coalescence times), can build a life table, estimate the hazards, and infer \\(N(t)\\). 10.8 Inference from MRCA times: \\(n &gt; 2\\) comparisons and relative branch lengths Detour to length of branches A sample of 3: Note we’re using \\(N\\) (not \\(2N\\)) Intuition: when we have more individuals, there’s more chance that some pair of them will coalesce. Question: If we sample 4, how much of time to TMRCA do we have 4 branches, 3 branches, and 2 branches? 10.9 Reconstruction Ancient European Population Sizes using Batini’s sample of Mitochondrial DNA&quot; We use real sequences of mitochondrial DNA to estimate ancient population sizes. The sequences were made available by Batini et al, who analyzed sub-populations in their paper using software for Bayesian inference for comparing groups of individuals. Our approach here is to use a simpler, but less powerful approach. We will simply look at pairwise differences of random pairs of individuals. For this we are not going to do subgroups such as the Greeks or Irish, but are going to use the entire European sample. The population sizes we estimate are for the entire population represented by the 328 individuals. Special thanks to Ken Wachter, who taught me this approach and whose R-code forms the basis of this application 10.9.1 Summary of Batini et al. Before we begin our own analysis, let’s look at the inputs to Batini’s analysis – the mtDNA haplotype sequences, and then at the resulting population estimates. 10.9.1.1 The mitochondrial DNA Data preparation begins. There are 380 individuals grouped into regional sub-populations.

Q: How many pairwise differences in total are there between hap1 and hap2? These are the kind of comparisons we will be doing. 10.9.2 Ancient population estimates Let’s look at Figure 2 on page 5. Q. What was effective population size in Ireland 1 thousand years ago (according to mtDNA)? Q. What was effective population size in Ireland 50 thousand years ago (according to mtDNA)? Q. For the “Irish”, what is the annual population growth rate? What’s the NRR? The order of magnitude for each these populations appears to be about 10^4 in last few KYA and 10^3 50 KYA. Together, perhaps the size is 10 fold. So we’re looking at European effective population sizes on the order of 100,000 the last few thousand years and on the order of 10,000 tens of thousands of years ago. 10.9.2.1 Using the Coalescent to estimate changing population size Our procedure will involve a four steps: Pick 100 pairs of people at random and count their pairwise differences. set.seed(1) hap_ids = 1:ncol(H) hap_id_sample = sample(hap_ids, size = 200, replace = FALSE) hap_id.mat &lt;- matrix(hap_id_sample, 100, 2) pairwise_diff_fun &lt;- function(hap1, hap2) { h1 &lt;- hap1 h2 &lt;- hap2 ## h1 &lt;- unlist(strsplit(hap1, &quot;&quot;)) ## h2 &lt;- unlist(strsplit(hap2, &quot;&quot;)) h1[h1 == &quot;N&quot;] &lt;- NA ## note &quot;N&quot; means missing h2[h2 == &quot;N&quot;] &lt;- NA ## making these NA avoids counting as polymorphism k = sum(h1 != h2, na.rm = T) n_valid = sum(!is.na(h1) &amp; !is.na(h2)) return(list(k = k, n_valid = n_valid)) } pairwise_diff_fun(H[,1], H[,2]) ## $k ## [1] 45 ## ## $n_valid ## [1] 16565 Now we’re ready to do pairwise comparisons of all 100 pairs of haplotypes. We’ll define the fraction of locii that have mutated (the pairwise differences) as \\[ \\bar{Y} = P/C \\] P.vec = NULL C.vec = NULL for (i in 1:nrow(hap_id.mat)) { hap_id.1 = hap_id.mat[i,1] hap_id.2 = hap_id.mat[i,2] hap1 = H[,hap_id.1] hap2 = H[,hap_id.2] out = pairwise_diff_fun(hap1, hap2) P.vec[i] = out$k C.vec[i] = out$n_valid } Y.bar = P.vec/C.vec head(P.vec) ## [1] 19 36 13 39 5 84 head(C.vec) ## [1] 16566 16484 16539 16565 16565 16544 head(Y.bar) ## [1] 0.0011469274 0.0021839359 0.0007860209 0.0023543616 0.0003018412 0.0050773694 Estimate 100 different times of MRCA (\\(T\\)) using assumed mutation rate. And now we’ll use the mutation rate \\(\\theta_m\\) given by Batini to compute time back to MRCA. First, some background: Let \\(a\\) index sites and write \\(Y_a = 1\\) if the letters are different, and $Y_a = 0 otherwise. For 1 site, the probability that it there has been a mutation, is 1 minus the chance that there has been no mutation. $$ P( Y_a = 1 ) = 1 - e^{-T} \\[ The mean $\\bar{Y}$ across the segment is the proportion of $Y_a$ that equal 1. So, in expectation for the fraction of sites that mutate is the same as the probability that 1 site mutates (assuming independence of mutation probabilities by site). This allows us to write \\] E{{Y}} = 1 - e^{-2T}, $$ where we’ve added a “2” in order to account that either one of the pairwise branched could have had a mutation, so we our “exposure” is twice the time to MRCA. Rearranging we get an estimate $ of \\(T\\) to be \\[ \\hat{T} = {-\\log (1 - \\bar{Y} ) \\over \\theta} \\] Now we’re ready to estimate the MRCAs theta_m = 2.21 * 10^(-8) ## Batini page 6 (TMRCA estimation) T.vec &lt;- -(1/2) * (1/theta_m) * log(1 - Y.bar) ## TMRCAs in years ago head(T.vec, n = 10) ## [1] 25963.477 49464.349 17790.271 53328.902 6830.018 115165.228 56610.650 12294.775 21863.319 54701.270 Let’s visualize these hist(T.vec) We see a lot of coalescence about 50 KYA, which is as far back as Batini’s estimates go. This means the population was small back then. Estimate \\(h(t)\\), the time-varying hazard of coalescence We’ll do this in two ways. First we’ll compute the slope of the logarithm of the survival curve, but we’ll see that it is noisy and needs to be smoothed. Second, we’ll construct a “life table” of coalescence with discrete periods of time. Let’s start with the more continuous version of estimating slopes. ## Plot survival curve by order of T St = (100:1)/100 ## or more generally (length(T.vec):1)/length(T.vec) t = kya = sort(T.vec)/1000 plot(kya, St, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Kilo years ago&quot;, ylab = &quot;Fraction of pairs without common ancestor&quot;, main = &quot;Estimated probability of not coalescing&quot;) plot(kya, log(St), type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Kilo years ago&quot;, ylab = &quot;Log fraction of pairs without common ancestor&quot;, main = &quot;Etimatated probability of not coalescing, log scale&quot;) Q: What is happening to slope in first from 1,000 to 50,000 years ago? Q: What does this imply about hazard of coalescence? Q: What does this imply about effective population size? Estimating hazards from smoothed survival curve First we smooth. out = lowess(x = kya, y = St, f = 1/5) St_smooth = out$y kya_smooth = out$x plot(kya, St, cex = .5) lines(kya_smooth, St_smooth, type = &#39;l&#39;) Q. Is f=1/5 a decent fit? Try a different value. Hazards as minus the slope of log haz_hat = -diff(St_smooth)/diff(kya_smooth) plot(kya_smooth[-1], haz_hat, type = &#39;l&#39;) Q. Does this plot tell us anything about uncertainty? Life table appraoch Now let’s estimate the hazards using a “life table”, where again “death” is coalescence and “survival” is still not having a common ancestor. ## we choose these time boundaries arbitrarily ... not sure if ## we&#39;ll be able to see the &quot;expansion&quot; after ice age ... ## x = c(0, 12, 20, 40, 65, 180 )*1000 # time interval boundaries x = c(0,2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 65, 180) * 1000 ## time interval boundaries Define a function to count “exposure” by those pairs that have MRCA in time intervals get_nax &lt;- function(Ti, x) { ## get person years lived in interval by those who die nax &lt;- NULL for (i in 1:(length(x)-1)) { s &lt;- Ti &gt;= x[i] &amp; Ti &lt; x[i+1] if (length(Ti[s]) != 0) { nax[i] = mean(Ti[s] - x[i]) } nax[is.na(nax)] &lt;- 0 } return(nax) } Construct the life table n &lt;- diff(x) T.vec.by.cat &lt;- cut(T.vec, x, include.lowest = T, right = F) ndx = table(T.vec.by.cat) lx = rev(cumsum(rev(ndx))) lxpn = c(lx[-1], 0) nax = get_nax(Ti = T.vec, x = x) nLx = n*lxpn + nax * ndx ## exposure nmx = ndx/nLx ## hazard lt &lt;- cbind(x = x[-length(x)], n, ndx, lx, nax, nLx, nmx) print(lt) ## x n ndx lx nax nLx nmx ## [0,2e+03) 0 2000 0 100 0.000 200000.0 0.000000e+00 ## [2e+03,5e+03) 2000 3000 0 100 0.000 300000.0 0.000000e+00 ## [5e+03,1e+04) 5000 5000 3 100 3651.934 495955.8 6.048926e-06 ## [1e+04,2e+04) 10000 10000 7 97 6416.957 944918.7 7.408045e-06 ## [2e+04,3e+04) 20000 10000 7 90 3662.324 855636.3 8.181046e-06 ## [3e+04,4e+04) 30000 10000 19 83 6798.251 769166.8 2.470206e-05 ## [4e+04,6.5e+04) 40000 25000 54 64 11619.224 877438.1 6.154280e-05 ## [6.5e+04,1.8e+05] 65000 115000 10 10 24611.455 246114.6 4.063149e-05 Let’s compare the two estimates x.mid = x[-length(x)] + n/2 plot(x.mid, nmx, type = &#39;o&#39;) axis(2) lines(kya_smooth[-1] * 1000, haz_hat/1000, type = &quot;l&quot;) We’re getting basically the same thing, with a little more hint of rising hazards (shrinking pop size) in first 20 kya. Nearly the same thing estimate 40 kya ago, and very little signal before that. Estimate the population size \\(N_e(t)\\) In order to estimate the population size, we have to think for a minute about units. Our hazards are per year, but our logic for why hazards are related to population size is per generation. Remember, the chance of coalescence per generation was \\(1/N\\). This means we will want to multiply the annual hazard by generation length in order to get hazards per generation unit of time. Second, mtDNA is inherited only through mothers. So the coalescent that we are thinking of is only for women. And the effective population size we’re estimating is for females only. We can get a rough estimate of both sexes by doubling the number of females. Putting these two considerations together, we have \\[ \\hat{N_e(both sexes)} = 2 \\times {1 \\over 25 \\cdot h(t)}, \\] where the 2 inflates to both sexes, and the 25 inflates the annual hazard into geneations of 25 years in length.

How could we evaluate undercertainty? (Hint: resampling) Q. What does this estimate leave out? (We probably won’t do this in class. If we don’t give it a try at home.)

The general trend in growth is consistent with Batini but Our total population size seems smaller by a factor of about 4 or 5. We don’t have the resolution to see increase between 10 and 20 kya, the end of the Last Glacial Maximum or the more recent Bronze Age steppe expansion 2 to 5 kya. In order to get more resolution and study sub-group differences, we would want to turn to methods that do more than pair-wise comparisons, giving us more detailed information about the effective population sizes of the past. 10.10 Some exercises Try doing 150 pairwise comparisons (instead of 100) and see what happens. Try doing 50 pairwise comparisons (instead of 100) and see what happens. Try changing the interval sizes (or the smoothing parameter) to see if you can see either the post-glaciation population increase or the Bronze Age increase?

Data from the U.S. Black and White populations for the period 1935 to 1975. Mortality crossover (Blacks having relatively lower mortality rates) at age 75. Could be explained under the proposed model. Data quality? Variety of evidence supporting the existence of a crossover. Consequently, careful consideration should be made of the population mechanisms by which the crossover might occur. 11.1.3.2 A model of selection Life tables are separately calculated for the Black and White populations in the U.S. over the period 1935 to 1975 based upon the assumptions: Each population is heterogeneous. The initial distribution of individuals in each population is identical (within sex) with respect to variables relevant to longevity. -Individual’s environmental conditions are fixed at birth. Operationally, they modified standard life table calculations (Chiang, 1968) to reflect the dependence of mortality rates at advanced ages upon the selection of earlier mortality levels on a heterogeneous population. 11.1.3.3 A little bit of math Assumptions: The following partial differential equation governs the change of the distribution as cohort age: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial f_{x}(z)}{\\partial x}= f_{x}(z)(\\bar{\\mu}_{x}-\\mu_{x}(z)) \\end{aligned}\\] Each person retains the value of \\(z\\) (longevity characteristics) given at birth. Functional forms: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mu_{x}(z)=z\\mu_{x}(1)= z\\mu_{x} \\end{aligned}\\] Thus \\(z\\) may be taken to be a measure of relative (to the standard individual) frailty or “susceptibility to death”. Alternatively, \\(1/z\\) may be considered as a measure of vitality or “robustness”. Variance and frailty relation: We also have the following definitions: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\overline{\\mu}_x&amp;= \\overline{z}\\mu_x\\\\ \\overline{z}_x&amp;= \\int_0^\\infty z f_x(z) dz \\end{aligned}\\] Therefore, we can say that \\(\\frac{\\partial\\overline{z}_x}{\\partial x}=- \\mu_x \\sigma_x^2(z)\\) \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial f_x(z)}{\\partial x}&amp;=f_x(z)(\\overline{z}\\mu_x - z\\mu_x)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\overline{z}_x}{\\partial x}&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\int z f_x(z) dz}{\\partial x}\\\\ &amp;= \\int z \\frac{\\partial f_x(z) }{\\partial x}dz\\\\ &amp;= \\int z f_x(z)(\\overline{z}\\mu_x - z\\mu_x)dz \\\\ &amp;= \\mu_x \\left(\\int z f_x(z)\\overline{z} dz- \\int z^2 f_x(z)dz\\right)\\\\ &amp;= -\\mu_x \\left(\\int z^2 f_x(z)dz - \\overline{z} \\int z f_x(z) dz \\right)\\\\ &amp;= -\\mu_x \\left(\\int z^2 f_x(z)dz - \\overline{z}^2 \\right)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\overline{z}_x}{\\partial x}&amp;= - \\mu_x \\sigma_x^2(z) \\end{aligned}\\] This means the “frailer” population members (with high z’s) are being selected earlier than their more “robust” contemporaries (with low z’s) Gamma distribution: The proportionality assumption has implications for \\(f_x(z)\\) Mortality cannot be negative, then z must be positive. Average endowment, \\(\\overline{z}_0\\), for longevity, it follows that \\(\\overline{\\mu}_0=\\mu_0\\). Hence, \\(\\overline{z}_0=1\\) It would be desirable that the paramteres of \\(f_x\\) be unchanged for any \\(x\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} f_x(z)=z^{k-1}\\lambda_x^k exp(-z\\lambda_x)/\\Gamma(K) \\end{aligned}\\] With mean \\(\\overline{z}_x=k/\\lambda_x\\) and variance: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma_x^2(z) = \\overline{z}^2_x/k = k/\\lambda^2 \\end{aligned}\\] ASPD and the relative risk: From the variance of the gamma, the average mortality and the definition of \\(\\overline{s}_x\\), we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma_x^2(z)&amp;= \\overline{z}^2_x/k\\\\ \\overline{\\mu}_x&amp;= \\overline{z}_x\\mu_x\\\\ \\overline{s}_x&amp;= exp\\left(-\\int_0^x \\overline{\\mu}_t dt\\right)\\\\ nq_x(z) &amp;= 1-exp\\left(\\frac{kz}{\\overline{s}_x^{1/k}}-\\frac{kz}{\\overline{s}_{x+n}^{1/k}}\\right)\\\\ \\overline{r}_x&amp;= \\frac{\\mu_{x1}}{\\mu_{x2}}\\left(\\frac{\\overline{s}_{x1}}{\\overline{s}_{x2}}\\right)^{1/k} \\end{aligned}\\] 11.1.3.4 Parameter k Select values of k focus upon the biological rather than statistical Biological dimensions underlying longevity are normally distributed at birth. Any deviation from an “optimal” biological point will be associated with decreased survival. Conditionally on age, mortality will be a quadratic function Each individual’s endowment for longevity (z) is fixed at birth. The value of к is the result of n, number of dimensions relevant to longevity. The relation of n to the gamma shape parameter is simply n=2k. Lower n, the greater is the heterogeneity (higher variance of gamma) The values of n used are 1 and 2, suggesting that longevity is unidimensional (k=0.5) and bidimensional (k=1), respectively.

Source: Manton and Stallard (1981) 11.1.3.5 Takeaways It seems that the crossover at advanced ages for males is an artifact of the early differential mortality selection. An explanation for this differentials at older ages is the relatively more rapid reduction in individual white male mortality For black females we can see that they were worse off than males between 25-45 (the childbearing years) at 1935. Different Zs will result in a divergence between the increase with age of the cohort mortality rates and the age increase in the probabilities of death for individuals within the cohort. This because the earlier selection of the less “robust” population members, implies that individuals age “faster” than their cohorts. 11.1.4 CenSoc Mortality Crossovers Figure 11.7: Pooled cohorts of 1890-1900 Figure 11.8: Pooled cohorts of 1890-1900, by education level Figure 11.9: Pooled cohorts of 1890-1900 by location Figure 11.10: Pooled cohorts of 1890-1900 by wages 11.1.4.1 Can the crossover be eliminated? The baseline hazard is given by \\(\\mu_{0}(x)=\\bar{\\mu}(x)e^{\\sigma^{2}\\bar{H}(x)}\\) and we try different values of \\(\\sigma^2\\) for each group of people, in this case Black and White.

Figure 11.12: Day of death Figure 11.13: Month of death If observations with missing dates are dropped then the mortality rates look slightly different.

(2018): Recent paper claiming to be “the best evidence to date for the existence of extreme-age mortality plateaus in humans” Using total mortality rates for italian cohorts from 1900 to 1926 (from HMD), we can look at mortality rates over ages and cohorts, as an introduction to Barbi et al. (2018). When focusing on mortality rates above age 60, we see a constantly increasing curve with some variation at very old ages (beyond 100). One important limitation of our life tables is that the rates are only observed up until age 109. library(tidyverse) it &lt;- read_table(&quot;data/ITA.bltcoh_1x1.txt&quot;, skip=1) it$Age &lt;- as.numeric(it$Age) it$mx &lt;- as.numeric(it$mx) it$qx &lt;- as.numeric(it$qx) it &lt;- it %&gt;% mutate(mx = if_else(mx == 0, as.numeric(NA), mx)) Figure 11.16: Log mortality rates above age 60 after 1900 To detect plateaus above age 105 like the paper, we estimate a Gompertz on ages 60- 100 (there’s some noise from the war) after 1900. Recall that to estimate mortality using hazard rates for Gompertz: \\begin{aligned} h(x) = a e^{bx} \\ log(h{_x}) = log(a) + bx \\end{aligned*} Since we don’t have \\(h(x)\\) from the lifetable, we use \\({_1}m_x\\) min_gomp_age &lt;- 60 max_gomp_age &lt;- 105 max_plateau_age &lt;- 109 min_year &lt;- 1900 gomp &lt;- lm(log(mx) ~ Age, data = it %&gt;% filter(Age &gt; min_gomp_age &amp; Age &lt; max_gomp_age &amp; Year &gt; min_year)) new &lt;- data.frame(Age = max_gomp_age:max_plateau_age) new$Gomp.pred &lt;- exp(predict(gomp, new)) new &lt;- new %&gt;% left_join(it %&gt;% filter(Age &gt; max_gomp_age-1, Year &gt; min_year) %&gt;% select(Age, Year,mx) %&gt;% spread(Year, mx)) new &lt;- new %&gt;% gather(&quot;Year&quot;, &quot;mx&quot;, -Age) It seems that the Gompertz prediction is in line with the data, at least in its trend. However, note the variation in rates between every cohort. Figure 11.17: Predicted log mortality rates above age 104 after 1900 Now, we look at predicted mortality rates by gender. The graphs below show a similar trend as the previous graph for overall mortality rates. Although the predictions seem to fit the data, that is Gompertz is an adequate method to model mortality between the ages of 100 to 109, a plateau may appear for even later ages. Since HMD data uses ages up to 109, we are unable to observe a plateau as in Barbi et al.

Our challenge is to apply models of heterogeneity to this issue, particularly the result on mortality improvement over time. 11.3.1 Trends in mortality differentials and life expectancy for male social security-covered workers, by socioeconomic status (Waldron 2007) This paper fits in nicely with our discussion of heterogeneity and different rates of improvement across groups Analyzes trends in mortality differentials and life expectancy by average relative earnings for male Social Security-covered workers aged 60 or older Finds differences in level and rate of change in mortality improvement over time by SES “..male Social-Security covered workers born in 1941 who had average relative earnings in the top half of the earnings distribution and who lived to age 60 would be expected to live 5.8 more years than their counterparts in the bottom half. In contrast, among male Social Security-covered workers born in 1912 who survived to age 60, those in the top half of the earnings distribution would be expected to live only 1.2 years more than those in the bottom half.” Warns that these projections are very much only one possible outcome, since the causes of the widening differentials observed are still not understood 11.3.1.1 Context and data Historically, mortality inequalities by class that emerged between 1650-1850 began to narrow by the 1930s and 1940s (eg. Antonovsky 1967) Evidence that the gap has widened due to differential rates of decline in deaths due to heart disease (Feldman 1989) This paper adds to the literature by using a large longitudinal data set in which deaths are observed over 29 years This allows for disaggregation by age and year-of-birth, avoiding linearity assumptions with regard to interaction terms Wage data comes from the SSA Continuous Work History Sample, combined with the Numident (master death) file and the Master Beneficiary Record file Earnings are measured relative to the national average wage in the year, then averaged Earnings are only used post 1957 to account for expansion of Social Security coverage–some issues still exist due to subsequent expansions, but Waldron suggests that these should not have an important Important caveat: this is not a representative sample, as it excludes men not participating in the labor force and does not account for the possibility of low covered earnings combined with high non-covered earnings 11.3.1.2 Methods Estimates are constructed of mortality differentials and cohort and period life expectancies Models: Mortality differentials over time: \\(1(dead)_{isc}= \\alpha +\\beta_{1}age_{isc} + \\beta_{2}1(earnings)_{isc}+\\epsilon_{isc}\\) Cohort life expectancy estimates: Uses a discrete-time logistic regression model of the form \\(1(dead)_{isc}= \\gamma + \\theta_{1}age_{isc}+ \\theta_{2}birthyear_{isc} + \\theta_{3}age_{isc}\\times birthyear_{isc}+ \\theta_{4}1(earnings)_{isc}+ \\theta_{5}age_{isc}\\times 1(earnings)_{isc}+ \\theta_{6}birthyear_{isc}\\times 1(earnings)_{isc}+ \\theta_{7}age_{isc}\\times birthyear_{isc}\\times 1(earnings)_{isc}+\\varepsilon_{isc}\\) Does not control for changes in sample frailty over time: “Theoretically, if more frail members of lower-earnings groups are making it into the sample at older ages than in the past, then they could push up mortality differentials relative to the past. Hypothetically, it is possible that widening mortality differentials can indicate improvement for the lower-earnings groups, if such widening is an indication of their survival in greater numbers to ages at which previously only the strongest among them survived.” 11.3.1.3 Results Widening mortality differentials: Figure 11.22: Selected cohort survival curves for male Social Security-covered workers, by age and earnings group.

Source: Chart 3 Waldron (2007) These results also hold for cohort life expectancies, though for later birth cohorts the confidence intervals tend to overlap–projected estimates. Waldron, using period data, also attempts to compare these numbers to other OECD countries, finding that, at 65, high-earning Social Security-covered men rank close to population averages for multiple other countries like Canada, suggesting they do worse than high-earning men in these countries Men in the bottom quarter of the earning distribution “could expect to live roughly as long as the average Irishman” Differences in medical care and health behaviors? Short discussion of the differences in frailty across countries–Mexico is predicted to have a selectively healthier and more robust population at age 80 This paper offers insight into the way in which population heterogeneity may lead to very different outcomes–though questions about sample frailty remain. A simulation of mortality differentials over time shows that: Over time, for a given age, the differential has widened. Within the same cohort, across ages, the differential falls. Figure 11.25: Odds ratio (confidence intervals) for the bottom half of the earnings distribution relative to the top half of the distribution, by year of birth and age. Source: Table 1 Waldron (2007) We can replicate the results of the simulation below. We want to see if heterogeneity alone can explain the pattern in Waldron’s observations of hazard ratios declining by age and increasing from one cohort to the next. The key idea is that moving from one cohort to the next, holding age constant, is like moving to younger ages within a cohort. Just as moving to younger ages makes the observed hazard ratio larger, moving to a lower baseline mortality rate, holding age constant, also makes the hazard ratio larger. ## Waldron Simulation using Gamma-Gompertz t &lt;- 1:5 ## five different cohrots (say each 10 years apart) k &lt;- .25 ## amount of mortality decline per decade (about 2.5% per year) b &lt;- .1 ## gompertz slope a0 &lt;- 10^{-3} ## starting hazard (rather high) a0.vec &lt;- a0 * exp(-k * t) #hazard vector for every cohort, including a mortality decline x &lt;- 0:100 # mu.bar &lt;- a * exp(b * x) / (1 + (a * s2 / b) * (exp(b*x) - 1)) #gamma gompertz formula, where s2 is sigma^2 mu.1.bar.xt &lt;- matrix(NA, length(t), length(x)) # matrix of cohorts (rows) by ages (columns) mu.2.bar.xt &lt;- matrix(NA, length(t), length(x)) dimnames(mu.1.bar.xt) &lt;- list(t, x) dimnames(mu.2.bar.xt) &lt;- list(t, x) s2 &lt;- .2 for (i in 1:length(t)) #i: cohort counter { a1 &lt;- a0.vec[i] a2 &lt;- a1 * 2 mu.1.bar.xt[i,] &lt;- a1 * exp(b * x) / (1 + (a1 * s2 / b) * (exp(b*x) - 1)) # baseline hazard mu.2.bar.xt[i,] &lt;- a2 * exp(b * x) / (1 + (a2 * s2 / b) * (exp(b*x) - 1)) # population hazard } R.mat &lt;- mu.2.bar.xt/mu.1.bar.xt #odds ratio waldron.simu &lt;- R.mat[, x %in% seq(60, 100, 10)] print(waldron.simu) ## 60 70 80 90 100 ## 1 1.443725 1.226597 1.097246 1.038110 1.014365 ## 2 1.505985 1.273363 1.121510 1.048411 1.018370 ## 3 1.568061 1.325716 1.150818 1.061317 1.023465 ## 4 1.628069 1.382813 1.185699 1.077385 1.029930 ## 5 1.684373 1.443338 1.226496 1.097228 1.038107 Interestingly, you can see that after 5 decades, the \\(R(x)\\) curve has shifted over almost exactly 10 years. R(90, decade 1) nearly equals R(100, decade 5) and similarly for age 60, 70, and 80. We now block the lower right cells (so that our table looks like Waldron’s): ## 60 70 80 90 100 ## 1 1.44 1.23 1.10 1.04 1.01 ## 2 1.51 1.27 1.12 1.05 NA ## 3 1.57 1.33 1.15 NA NA ## 4 1.63 1.38 NA NA NA ## 5 1.68 NA NA NA NA We see a more rapid decline by age, and a less rapid increase by cohort. But qualitatively the pattern looks similar. Further investigation could try to choose more accurate \\(a0\\) and \\(b\\) parameters to match better with observed mortality rates. Note: the true risk of being in group 2 instead of 1 is R = 2. So it’s not that by cohort 5 we’re seeing a distortion of the R(60). Rather we’re seeing convergence of the population value to the individual risk. "]
