*Fisher-Wright*

  - Children picking their parents (not "generative")
  - Total population size is constant
  - Qualitatively similar to BP. Extinction and fixation.
  - Flexible: mutation, selection, even changes in pop size.
  - With apologies, biologists take FW "seriously" even if they
    don't take it "literally".

<div class="column-right">
  *Galton-Watson-Bienaym\'e Branching Processe*
  
  - Branching process models independent parents randomly
    producing offspring. "Generative"
  - Total population size can vary, and has a random component and
    deterministic one $m$
  - Qualitative result when $m = 1$ is that there is one longest
    surviving line. This is "fixation", when one _type_ becomes
    universal.

### Another cell phone example
Let's simulate and draw lines

Gen 1   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9

Gen 2

Gen 3

- What will happen?

## Mutation

Simulation

```{r}
  fwm <- function(N, n_gen, mu = 0) ## mu != 4/N
  {
      ## simulate fisher-wright (with mutations)
      x <- paste(1:N) ## starting types
      A <- matrix(NA, nrow = n_gen, ncol = N)
      for (i in 1:n_gen)
      {
          A[i,] <- x
          x <- sample(x, size = N, replace = T)
          x <- mut(x, mu)
          x
      }
      return(A) ## matrix of types, each line a generation.
  }
```


```{r}
  mut <- function(x, mu)
  {
      ## m, the individuals that mutate
      m <- which(rbinom(length(x), 1, mu) == 1)
      if (length(m) == 0) ## if no-one mutates
          return(x)
      ## add a suffix to their ID, so it will be unique (infinite alleles)
      suffix <- 10000*round(runif(length(m)),4)
      x[m] <- paste0(x[m], ".", suffix)
      x
  }
```

Trying it out
```{r}
  set.seed(1)
  fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 2, mu = 0)
  fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 2, mu = 0)
```   

Trying it out some more

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
  set.seed(1)
  A <- fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 20, mu = 0)
  tt <- table(A, row(A)) ## count types by row
  ptt <- prop.table(tt, 2) ## proportions
  matplot(t(ptt), type = 'l', lty = 1, main = "FW simu")
  text(x = 4, y = jitter(ptt[,4]), rownames(ptt), col = 1:6)
``` 

Questions: 

- What happens at time 15?
- Why does line 5 rise and fall?
- What happens at time 2?
- What is $E(p_i(t) | p_i(t-1))$?


Bigger pop and more time
```{r, fig.height = 4}
  set.seed(1)
  A <- fwm(N = 100, n_gen = 200, mu = 0)
  tt <- table(A, row(A)) ## count types by row
  ptt <- prop.table(tt, 2) ## proportions
  matplot(t(ptt), type = 'l', lty = 1)
``` 
  
  - What does this remind you of? What will happen in long run?
  - What other questions could we ask?
  
## Fixation
Questions we can ask
  
  - What is probability that line $i$ will ``fix''? (Hint: easy)
  - What is expected time until some line fixes? (We'll demo the result)
  - How can we describe the path to fixation? (We'll derive the result)
  
  
Probability that a particular line will "fix"
```{r, fig.height = 5}
  set.seed(1)
  A <- fwm(N = 10, n_gen = 20, mu = 0)
  tt <- table(A, row(A)) ## count types by row
  ptt <- prop.table(tt, 2) ## proportions
  matplot(t(ptt), type = 'l', lty = 1, main = "FW simu")
  text(x = 4, y = jitter(ptt[,4]), rownames(ptt), col = 1:6)
``` 

Expected time until fixation?

  Answer for us is
  $$
  \bar{T}_{fixed} = 2 \cdot N
  $$
  Note: Biologists say $4 N_e$. See Wikipedia "Genetic drift"
  

Simulation of time to fixation
```{r}
  T.vec <- NULL
  all.the.same <- function(x){length(unique(x)) == 1}
  set.seed(10)
  for (i in 1:100)
  {
      A <- fwm(N = 100, n_gen = 1000,mu = 0)
      extinction_time = min(row(A)[apply(A, 1, all.the.same)])
      T.vec[i] <- extinction_time
  }
  mean(T.vec)
```

### Path to fixation: a measure of homogeneity/heterogeneity

  Chance that two randomly drawn individuals are of same type.
  $$
  G = \sum_i p_i^2
  $$

  If we have two types, $p_1 = \pi$ , $p_2 = 1-\pi$?
  What is G if $\pi = 0, .5, 1$?


Let's derive time path of G

  Let's assume just two types, $\pi(t)$

  Chance two indiv are of same type
  $$
  G_{t+1} = P(\mbox{same parent})\cdot 1 +
  P(\mbox{different parent})\cdot G_{t}
  $$

  Notation: I'm going use $K$ for pop size. Bio uses $2N$.
  $$
  G_{t+1} = {1 \over K} \cdot 1 + (1 - {1\over K}) \cdot G_{t}
  $$

  Easier to solve letting $H = 1 - G$. Some algebra gives
  $$
  H_{t+1} = H_{t} (1 - 1/K)
  $$

  Or,
  $$
  H_{t} = H_0 (1 - 1/K)^t % \rightarrow H_0 e^{-t/K}
  $$
  So, H goes to 0 exponentially, just as G goes to 1.


## Baby Names

>  "Drift as a mechanism for cultural change: an example from baby names"
by Matthew W. Hahn and R. Alexander Bentley Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 2003 270, S120-S123

### What's the basic idea?
  
  - How is naming a baby like Fisher-Wright?
  - How is it not?
  
Applying

  - Like Fisher-Wright 
    - people choose from existing set (?)
    - names are "neutral" (?)
    - draw proportionally (?)
  - They test to see if they can reject FW
    - compare observed histograms to FW simulation
  - They include mutation to get a stationary disn
  Note: failing to reject FW doesn't mean it's correct

Their picture 

![Baby Names by Matthew W. Hahn and R. Alexander Bentley Proc. R.Soc. Lond. B 2003 270, S120-S123](/hdir/0/fmenares/Book/bookdown-master/images/hahn_pic.png)


### Fisher-Wright simulation of Baby Names (Hahn and Bentley)

Drwaing their Picture

Data prep

```{r}
download.file(url= "https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip",
              "./names.zip")
unzip("names.zip", exdir = "./names")

library(data.table)

filenames <- system("ls ./names/*.txt", intern = T)
mylist <- vector("list", length(filenames))
names(mylist) <- gsub(pattern = "[^0-9]", replace = "", filenames)
for (i in 1:length(filenames))
{
    myfile <- filenames[i]
    mylist[[i]] <- fread(myfile)
}

dt <- rbindlist(mylist, idcol = "year")
names(dt) <- c("year", "name", "sex", "N")
``` 

ok, we have the data now


Plot observed frequencies
```{r}
## male 1900-1909
my.dt <- dt[sex == "M" & year %in% 1900:1909]
foo <- my.dt[, .(N = sum(N)), by = name]
foo <- foo[order(N, decreasing = T)]
bar <- foo[1:1000,] ## 1000 top names
```

now let's do a power law plot
```{r}
my.breaks <- c(0, 2^(0:11)/10000)
bar[, p := round(prop.table(N),5)]
bar[, pcat := cut(p, breaks =  my.breaks, right = F, include.lowest = T)]

out <- unclass(prop.table(table(bar$pcat)))


my.x <- my.breaks[-length(my.breaks)] + diff(my.breaks)/2
plot(my.x, out, log = "xy")
```

### Drawing their picture with simulation

FW simulation
```{r}
mut <- function(x, mu)
{
    ## m, the individuals that mutate
    m <- which(rbinom(length(x), 1, mu) == 1)
    if (length(m) == 0)
        return(x)
    suffix <- 10000*round(runif(length(m)),4)
    x[m] <- paste0(x[m], ".", suffix)
    x
}

fwm <- function(N, n_gen, mu = 0)
{
x <- paste(1:N)
A <- matrix(NA, nrow = n_gen, ncol = N)
for (i in 1:n_gen)
{
    A[i,] <- x
    x <- sample(x, size = N, replace = T)
    x <- mut(x, mu)
    x
}
return(A)
}
```

Let's look at evolution over time of G: chance that two individuals are of same type
```{r}
get.G <- function(x)
{
    tt <- table(x)
    p <- prop.table(tt)
    sum(p^2)
}
```

without mutation
```{r}
A <- fwm(1000, n_gen = 4000, mu = 0)
G.vec <- apply(A, 1, get.G)
plot(G.vec)
```

with mutation, 1 trial

```{r}
N = 1000
A <- fwm(N, n_gen = 3000, mu = 4/N)
G.vec <- apply(A, 1, get.G)
plot(G.vec)
```
average over 100 trials

```{r}
n_gen = 2000
n_trials = 100
G.mat <- matrix(NA,  n_trials, n_gen)
for (i in 1:n_trials)
    {
        N = 1000
        A <- fwm(N, n_gen, mu = 4/N)
        G.vec <- apply(A, 1, get.G)
        G.mat[i,] <- G.vec
        }
matplot(t(G.mat), type = "l")

G.bar <- apply(G.mat, 2, mean)
lines(G.bar, lwd = 4)
abline(h = 1/9, lty = 3, col = "yellow", lwd = 5)
```
cool plot, why is it about .11?
```{r}
1/(1 + 8)

```

Gillespie tells us that Gbar is supposed to be 1 / (1 + 4*Ne*mu)

How does 4*Ne*mu = 8?

Well, we have $K*mu = 4$ and since $K = 2*Ne$, $Ne = = K/2$ (maybe)

### FW babyname simulation of equilibrium frequencies 

```{r}
N = 1000 ## Not sure if this is (w)right :)
mu = 4/N ## [1] 0.004
theta = N*mu ## [1] 4 ## H&B's "best fit"
```

## Now we can simulate babyynmes
```{r}
n_gen = 1001
N = 1000
## set.seed(1)
## A <- fwm2(N, n_gen, mu = 4/N)
#A <- fwm2(N, n_gen, mu = 8/N)
###############
#What about the fwm2 function?
#######################
A <- fwm(N, n_gen, mu = 8/N)
## ok, lets do power law plot of this
x <- A[1001,]
tt <- table(x)
ptt <- prop.table(tt)
my.breaks <- c(0, 2^(0:11)/10000)
p <- ptt
## bar[, p := round(prop.table(N),5)]
##bar[, pcat := cut(p, breaks =  my.breaks, right = F, include.lowest = T)]
pcat = cut(p, breaks =  my.breaks, right = F, include.lowest = T)
out <- unclass(prop.table(table(bar$pcat)))
out.hat <- unclass(prop.table(table(pcat)))
my.x <- my.breaks[-length(my.breaks)] + diff(my.breaks)/2
plot(my.x, out, log = "xy")
lines(my.x, out.hat)
```

## Conclusions
  
  - Fisher-Wright an alternative to branching processes
  - It reverses logic of reproduction, but gives similar
    quantitative and qualitative results
  - A neutral model for other processes?
  - Starting point for coalescent

### Some potential criticism
  
  - While we can't reject that there's some parameterization of
    FW that gives us similar disn, this doesn't mean that we've
    found the right mechanism. (Just that we can't reject it).
  
  - What are some other tests of this mechanism?
  
  - Markov assumption. We could see if each frequency really
    followed random walk.
  - Perhaps we could see if variances were scaled to
    frequencies correctly.
